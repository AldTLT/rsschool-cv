3. Since school I liked programming, so I always wanted to work in this area. At the moment, my job is programming industrial controllers, but I would like to go into software development. Now my goal is a full stack developer.
I am quite motivated, and I like to study, these are my strongest qualities that will help in further work. Despite the busy days, I always find time to study, maybe a foreign language, programming, or something else.
